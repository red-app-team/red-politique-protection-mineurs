    <h1>Child Protection and Prevention of Sexual Abuse Policy</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>Red</strong> app is committed to providing a safe and secure
      environment for all of its users. We have a zero-tolerance policy for
      child exploitation and sexual abuse of minors and have implemented strict
      measures to prevent and report any inappropriate content or behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Strict Prohibition of Inappropriate Content</h2>
    <p>We strictly prohibit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any content that exploits or depicts minors in an inappropriate manner.
      </li>
      <li>Any behavior that encourages or facilitates child exploitation.</li>
      <li>
        Any attempts at inappropriate communication with a minor through our
        platform.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any such content will be immediately removed and reported to the relevant
      authorities.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Abuse Reporting Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
      We provide a <strong>reporting system</strong> for users to alert us to
      any suspicious content or behavior. Reports are handled with the utmost
      attention, and actions may include suspension or permanent removal of the
      involved account.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Moderation and Manual Review</h2>
    <p>
      Our team performs <strong>active moderation</strong> of all reported
      issues to ensure compliance with this policy. Any proven violations will
      result in immediate action.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Legal Compliance and Cooperation with Authorities</h2>
    <p>
      We comply with local and international laws regarding the protection of
      minors and collaborate with authorities in cases of verified abuse
      reports. Any illegal content will be forwarded to the appropriate
      agencies.
